# The-Past-of-Today

My first Front-End Web design and development project.
This was done during the my first semester of study at The University of Queensland.

The main aim of this project was for us to understand the design process of a web development project.
Prior to development of the code seen here, a whole UI and UX design process was undertaken.

This consisted of Research, Prototyping, Wireframing, User Testing and Validation in mulitple stages.
